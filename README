This repository consists of all the coding assignments I completed for the class Intro to Data and Text Mining at the University of South Florida in the Spring of 2021.

The class consisted of completing homework assignments and lab each week. We learned various visualization techniques using ggplot2, text mining, linear modelling, SVM, 
  mining twitter data, and how to develop shiny web applications.
