# Instructions

Use the built-in `airquality` R dataset to visualize the air quality in 1973.
Explore the patterns in the data by creating histograms, boxplots, line graphs, 
heatmaps, and scatterplots. 

Load the libraries `ggplot2` and `reshape2` in the setup chunk below.

---

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
# Add your library below.
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(dplyr)


```

# Step 1 - Load the Data

We will use the `airquality` dataset that you have as part of your R installation. 
Read the `airquality` data using the `data.frame()` function and save it as `air`.

```{r, "Step 1"}
# Write your code below.
air <- data.frame(airquality)


```

---

# Step 2 - Clean the Data

After you load the data, there will be some NA values in the data. 
You need to figure out what to do about those nasty NAs. Google is your friend. 
Use Google actively to find a way to get rid of NAs using R. 

**HINT:** Find columns that include NA values first 
(use `colSums()` function, then replace NAs with the mean value of these columns).

Optional: If you want to implement a better approaches to deal with missing data, 
"multiple imputation" would be where you should go.

```{r, "Step 2"}
# Write your code below.
sum(is.na(air$Ozone))
sum(is.na(air$Solar.R))
sum(is.na(air$Wind))
sum(is.na(air$Temp))
sum(is.na(air$Month))
sum(is.na(air$Day))
# only the Ozone and Solar.R columns have NA values present

# Replacing NAs with the mean value of air$Ozone and air$Solar.R for each respective column.
air$Ozone[which(is.na(air$Ozone))] <- round(mean(air$Ozone[which(!is.na(air$Ozone))]))
air$Solar.R[which(is.na(air$Solar.R))] <- round(mean(air$Solar.R[which(!is.na(air$Solar.R))]))


```

---


# Step 3 - Understand the data distribution

Create the following visualizations:

 - Histograms for each of the variables
 - Boxplot for `Ozone`, and boxplots for different `wind` values 
 (round `wind` to get a good number of “buckets”) 
 
**HINT:** you can create one graph with `Ozone` as X-axis and `Wind` as Y-axis. 
Also, you can create two graphs (one with `Ozone` values on the Y-axis, and 
another one with Y-axis value is rounded value of `Wind`). In this case, you need 
to create a fake grouping variable `(x = factor(0))`.

```{r, "Step 3"}
# Write your code below.
ozone_hist <- ggplot(air, aes(Ozone)) +
        geom_histogram() +
        labs(title = "Ozone") +
        xlab('Ozone (ppb)') +
        ylab('Count')
ozone_hist

solar_hist <- ggplot(air, aes(Solar.R)) +
        geom_histogram() +
        labs(title = 'Solar Radiation') +
        xlab('Solar Radiation (Langleys)') +
        ylab('Count')
solar_hist

wind_hist <- ggplot(air, aes(Wind)) +
        geom_histogram() +
        labs(title = 'Wind') +
        xlab('Average Wind Speed (mph)') +
        ylab('Count')
wind_hist

temp_hist <- ggplot(air, aes(Temp)) +
        geom_histogram() +
        labs(title = 'Temperature') +
        xlab('Maximum Daily Temperature (F)') +
        ylab('Count')
temp_hist

month_hist <- ggplot(air, aes(Month)) +
        geom_histogram() +
        labs(title = 'Month') +
        xlab('Month') +
        ylab('Count')
month_hist

day_hist <- ggplot(air, aes(Day)) +
        geom_histogram() +
        labs(title = 'Days') +
        xlab('Calendar Day') +
        ylab('Count')
day_hist

# Boxplot
boxplot <- ggplot(air, aes(x = Ozone, y = round(Wind))) +
        geom_boxplot() +
        labs(title = "Wind vs. Ozone Boxplot") +
        xlab('Ozone (ppb)') +
        ylab('Average Wind Speed (mph)')
boxplot

boxplot_2 <- ggplot(air, aes(x = factor(0), y = Ozone)) +
        geom_boxplot() +
        labs(title = "Ozone Boxplot") +
        xlab('') +
        ylab('Ozone (ppb)')
boxplot_2

boxplot_3 <- ggplot(air, aes(x = factor(0), y = round(Wind))) +
        geom_boxplot() +
        labs(title = "Wind") +
        xlab('') +
        ylab('Wind (mph)')
boxplot_3                            
                           

```

# Step 4 - Explore how the data changes over time

First, create the appropriate dates (this data was from 1973). 
Then create line charts for `Ozone`, `Temp`, `Wind` and `Solar.R` 
(one line chart for each, and then one chart with 4 lines, each variable having a different color). 

**HINT:** 

1. Combine (use `paste()` function) 1973 with the `Month` and `Day` columns,
using "/" in between
2. Use `as.Date()` function to transform the value to "Date" format and create 
a `Date` column to record this value. Use `?as.Date` to find example use of this function.

Note that for the chart with 4 lines, you need to think about how to effectively use the y-axis. 

**HINT:** 
You need to "melt" the columns so that it becomes "long" format. You can either 
use the `melt()` function or use the `gather()` from the "tidyr" package for the process. 
Also, compared to other values, the `Wind` values are too small, 
so they are close to the x-axis. You need to multiply `Wind` by 10 to address this problem. 

The correct result should look like this:
![Step 4 Line Graph](data/week3hw1.PNG)

```{r, "Step 4"}
# Write your code below.
air$Date <- paste(air$Month, '/', air$Day, '/', 1973) %>% 
        as.Date(format = '%m / %d / %Y')

line_ozone <- ggplot(air, aes(x = Date, y = Ozone)) +
        geom_line() +
        labs(title = 'Ozone Levels in 1973 May - Oct') +
        xlab('Date') +
        ylab('Ozone (ppb)')
line_ozone

line_temp <- ggplot(air, aes(x = Date, y = Temp)) +
        geom_line() +
        labs(title = 'Temperature Levels in 1973 May - Oct') +
        xlab('Date') +
        ylab('Temperature (F)')
line_temp

line_wind <- ggplot(air, aes(x = Date, y = Wind)) +
        geom_line() +
        labs(title = 'Wind Speeds in 1973 May - Oct') +
        xlab('Date') +
        ylab('Average Wind Speed (mph)')
line_wind

line_solar <- ggplot(air, aes(x = Date, y = Solar.R)) +
        geom_line() +
        labs(title = 'Solar Radiation Levels in 1973 May - Oct') +
        xlab('Date') +
        ylab('Solar Radiaiton (Langleys)')
line_solar

library(tidyr)

air_long <- air
air_long$Wind <- air_long$Wind * 10
air_long <- air_long %>%
        gather("Measure", "Value", 1:4)

line_combined <- ggplot(air_long, aes(x = Date, y = Value, group = Measure, color = Measure)) +
        geom_line() +
        labs(title = "Combined Weather Measurements in 1973 May - Oct",
             caption = "Wind scaled up by 10 for readability purposes.")

line_combined
```
 

# Step 5: Look at all the data via a heatmap

Create a heatmap, with each day (using dates) along the x-axis and 
`Ozone`, `Temp`, `Wind` and `Solar.r` along the y-axis.

Note that you need to figure out how to show the relative change equally across 
all the variables. 

**HINTS:**

- Melt the original table to make a long format before visualization using `geom_tile()`

Remember, your programming skills will improve as much as you struggle and 
put effort in them.

The correct result should look like this:
![Step 4 Line Graph](data/week3hw2.PNG)

```{r, "Step 5"}
# Write your code below.
heatmap <- ggplot(air_long, aes(x = Date, y = Measure)) +
        geom_tile(aes(fill = Value)) +
        scale_fill_gradient(low = 'white', high = 'blue')

heatmap

```

# Step 6: Look at all the data via a scatter chart

Create a scatter chart, with:
 - the x-axis representing the `Wind`
 - the y-axis representing the `Temp`
 - the size of each dot representing the `Ozone`
 - the color representing `Solar.R`

```{r, "Step 6"}
# Write your code below.
scatter <- ggplot(air, aes(x = Wind, y = Temp, size = Ozone, color = Solar.R)) +
        geom_point() +
        scale_color_gradient(low = 'green', high = 'red') +
        labs(title = 'Weather Data for New York City May - Oct 1973',
             subtitle = 'Temparture vs. Wind')

scatter

```

# Step 7: Final analysis
### You MUST answer to these questions in your compiled file.

Do you see any patterns after exploring the data?

> [Wind speed inversely correlates with temperature, as days with high wind speed
have low temperatures and vice versa. Ozone, solar radiation, and temperature all
directly correlated, as days with higher temperatures also have high ozone and solar
radiation levels.]

What was the most useful visualization?

> [The scatter plot was the most useful since it effectively combined all the variables
into one plot and allowed for easy interpretation, unlike the combined line graph which
had all the datapoints overlapping and was hard to read. The heatmap was only 
slightly worse than the scatter plot.]
